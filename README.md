Environment Variables
---------------------

Some of these variables must be defined in order for OpenSSL to generate certs.
I don't know which are required, so I define all of them and it works.

* `COUNTRY_CODE`
* `STATE_CODE`
* `LOCALITY_NAME`
* `ORGANIZATION_NAME`
* `ORG_UNIT_NAME`
* `COMMON_NAME`
